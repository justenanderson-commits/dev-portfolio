      <div className="mx-20 my-10">I am a kind, hard-working person with a strong record of successful teamwork in the military, education, and private industry. Collaborating, mentoring, and learning from others feeds my soul and fuels my success. I value honesty, deep connections and achievement.
<br></br><br></br>
A voracious learner, I continually reach for new skills and experiences that will help me add value to my organization and broader community. If I'm without the skills to complete a project, I eagerly deep-dive into research and practice until I have the skillset needed to succeed.<br></br><br></br>

Complex and technical challenges excite me. I am fueled by the sense of achievement from persevering and overcoming struggles. Excellence, integrity, and service are my personal core values. I work with purpose to improve products, processes, and the lives of people around me.
<br></br><br></br>
Oh, and I'm pretty good at coding too :)</div>
